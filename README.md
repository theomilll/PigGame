# PigGame

Pig Game is a fun, interactive dice game I built during a JavaScript Bootcamp. It's designed for two players. Each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish, each roll adding points to their turn total. Rolling a 1 loses all points for the turn and ends the player's turn.

# Installation

No installation is necessary. You can play the game directly in your web browser. Just clone or download this repository, and open index.html in your browser.
